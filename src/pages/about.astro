              <p>
                Hello! I'm a passionate third-year software engineering student with a love for creating innovative, user-friendly applications.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me outdoors, spending time with friends and family, or learning about something new. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and as a person.
              </p>

              <p>
                My two main motivators are: problem solving and system usability. The course I have most enjoyed at university is Cosc-262, Algorithms. I found learning about and understanding various software algorithms along with their applications challenging, but also very interesting. When using software I am impatient. This means that I have a great appreciation for user-friendly, well-written software - which is reflected in the code I write.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I'm currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and learn from experienced professionals. Feel free to reach out if you think we could work together!
